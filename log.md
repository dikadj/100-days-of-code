# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: Sunday, April 7th, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
1. I worked on an old personal project of mine called "ecommerce-footwear", as you can guess what it is for from the project's name, it's an ecommerce site (a mock though). I plan on improving it by wrapping it's state using Redux and adding some accessibility features to it. There are still a few errors with some migrations as I updated the dependencies, I'll come back later.

2. I built this anime finder app as I recap on what I learnt on Redux. It's nothing fancy, just an anime finder app using some API to fetch the titles to put them on the list. I didn't really pay attention to the styling though as I only focused on building the data using Redux.

**Thoughts**: It's a bit tedious to maintain the app as in the past I ejected the app from "create-react-app" for enabling Sass features. As now it is now supported by create-react-app by default, I tried to convert it's ejected config to use the default create-react-app config for ease of maintenance

### Day 2: Monday, April 8th, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
1. I continued working on ecommerce-footwear project. I successfully reapplied create-react-app default config (undo eject) as well as updating and migrating some dependencies. I also wrote some reducers to hold the current data for later use in Redux.

2. I built an analog clock using React, SVG, and jQuery. Nothing much from the looks, just for fun.

**Thoughts**:
1. ecommerce-footwear project: Well, there were some unexpected errors and warning the first time I applied the changes. But, successfully fixed though there are a few warnings about empty <a> anchor tag's "href". Gonna fix them later. And also, the popover feature's not working anymore. I've tried removing the duplicate jQuery, using .noConflict function, and also anything I found on the internet is also not working.

2. analog-clock-js: I didn't have any problem in creating this one, I like it when things went smoothly and hope it'll affect the next ones also in good ways.

### Day 3: Tuesday, April 9th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixing viewport for analog clock I created previously to center the clock in viewport, I also put my code in Codepen to view the result easily.

**Thoughts**: analog-clock-js: When putting my code in Codepen, I needed to modify the code slightly as Codepen didn't support import/export. I actually could use CDN from the Codepen's settings, but I prefer to declare my code explicitly, so that I'm aware of what I'm doing. So, I put them in the HTML file.

### Day 4: Wednesday, April 10th, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
1. Improving syntax semantics for readability in my keyboard & mouse event detector app. Also relocating all inline styles in a separate file using Sass.

2. Rebuilding "Jimi Hendrix Tribute" page as part of freecodecamp's challenge.

**Thoughts**:
1. mouse-and-keyboard-event-detector: Some of the events didn't work in Codepen, gonna need to find the solution later.

2. Tribute Page: because I built the page with only HTML and Bootstrap, the styling became a bit tricky as there were a lot of classes. I also needed to readjust the image for different breakpoints, it took a bit more time than I expected but it was worthwhile, so I won't complain.

### Day 5: Thursday, April 11th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Solving some challenge in Codewars. I leveled up by only solving 2 of 6th level kata.

**Thoughts**: The problems were not that much of a hassle, it's just it took a bit time for me to think about a solution.
