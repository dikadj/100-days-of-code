# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: Sunday, April 7th, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
1. I worked on an old personal project of mine called "ecommerce-footwear", as you can guess what it is for from the project's name, it's an ecommerce site (a mock though). I plan on improving it by wrapping it's state using Redux and adding some accessibility features to it. There are still a few errors with some migrations as I updated the dependencies, I'll come back later.

2. I built this anime finder app as I recap on what I learnt on Redux. It's nothing fancy, just an anime finder app using some API to fetch the titles to put them on the list. I didn't really pay attention to the styling though as I only focused on building the data using Redux.

**Thoughts**: It's a bit tedious to maintain the app as in the past I ejected the app from "create-react-app" for enabling Sass features. As now it is now supported by create-react-app by default, I tried to convert it's ejected config to use the default create-react-app config for ease of maintenance

### Day 2: Monday, April 8th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on ecommerce-footwear project. I successfully reapplied create-react-app default config (undo eject) as well as updating and migrating some dependencies. I also wrote some reducers to hold the current data for later use in Redux.

**Thoughts**: Well, there are some unexpected errors and warning the first time I applied the changes. But, successfully fixed though there are a few warnings about empty <a> anchor tag's "href". Gonna fix them later.
